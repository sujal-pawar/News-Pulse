## Current Issues
- The API used for fetching news has a limit of few requests, which may restrict the availability of news updates. This can be resolved by purchasing a monthly plan, but as a student, I currently don't have plans for that.
- After loading **10-12 news items** in the unlimited scroller, the news starts to repeat, affecting the user experience.
